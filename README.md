Recipe Box is an Android app that finds recipes for you to make based on a picture you choose. All you have to do is take a picture or upload one you already have, and Recipe Box does the rest!

# Dependencies
Recipe Box uses the [Clarifai Food Model](https://www.clarifai.com/models/food-image-recognition-model-bd367be194cf45149e75f01d59f77ba7 "Clarifai") and [Recipe Puppy](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/ "Recipe Puppy") APIs.


# Usage
To use this app you will need:
  - Android phone
  - Computer
  - Android Studio
  - Cable to connect your phone to the computer
  
To install, clone this repo onto your computer, connect your Android phone, and use Android Studio to load the app directly onto your phone. You will need access to the internet from your phone
because the app uses external APIs to fetch the recipe data
